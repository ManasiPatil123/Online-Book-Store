# üìö Online Bookstore - SQL Database Project

This project is a simple yet comprehensive SQL-based implementation of an **Online Bookstore**. It involves the design and querying of a relational database using **PostgreSQL**. The database contains essential entities such as **Books**, **Customers**, and **Orders**, with various queries demonstrating both beginner and advanced SQL operations.

## üõ† Technologies Used

- **PostgreSQL**
- SQL (DDL, DML, and advanced queries)
- pgAdmin / SQL Shell for query execution

---

## üìÇ Project Structure

- **DDL Statements**: Table creation with appropriate data types, primary and foreign key constraints.
- **DML Queries**: Insertion and retrieval queries for Books, Customers, and Orders.
- **Basic Queries**: Filtering, sorting, and aggregating data.
- **Advanced Queries**: Complex joins, grouping, and analytical operations.

JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name
ORDER BY Total_Spent DESC
LIMIT 1;
